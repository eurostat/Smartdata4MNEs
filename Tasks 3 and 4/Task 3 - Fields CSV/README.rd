These are the "manually" created files which indicates which obtained fields from each open source
can be further used and organised as variables.

This is a step that is NOT needed to be done every time the user runs the programs.
For example, one can simply use the supplied .csv files here and never investigate which fields can form variables.

However, for completeness, if one changes these files, could directly change the obtained/organised variables.
